# Task-Scheduler
Software Construction and Unit Testing

Description:

We will be using C++, github, PuTTy, and gtest. C++ for an objected oriented programming workspace since we are all most proficient at it. GitHub for version control system and for a backup repository. PuTTY to connect to Hammer. GTest to create unit tests and make sure the program's classes work as intended.
