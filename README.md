# Task-Scheduler
Software Construction and Unit Testing

Description:

Implemented the Structural-Composite design pattern as a part of our Task Scheduler and the Creational-Builder design pattern to handle the varying types of tasks.

Input will be taken from the users to generate visual blocks of Tasks with due dates, descriptions, and further details. Output will display a calendar with the tasks in a user-friendly manner. The program will notify users if their task is due today. Output will display a calendar with the tasks in a user-friendly manner. The program will notify users if their task is due today.

Used C++, github, PuTTy, and gtest. C++ for an objected oriented programming workspace, GitHub for version control system and for a backup repository, PuTTY to connect to Hammer, and GTest to create unit tests and make sure the program's classes work as intended.
